    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>DFF (Direct From Farmers)</strong>, a dedicated initiative born from a simple yet powerful idea: bring farm-fresh, locally sourced produce directly to the hands of consumersâ€”without middlemen, without delay, and without compromise.</p>

    <p>We are a Tamil Naduâ€“based collective working hand-in-hand with farmers to create an online marketplace where transparency meets tradition. Our goal is to empower the farming community by giving them a digital storefront that reflects the true value of their work. Consumers can explore a variety of agricultural products like vegetables, fruits, rice bags, millets, greens, and dhall varietiesâ€”sourced directly from the farms that nurture them.</p>

    <h3>ðŸŒ¾ Our Mission</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To establish <strong>fair trade channels</strong> between farmers and buyers.</li>
      <li>To ensure <strong>quality and freshness</strong> by cutting down storage and transit time.</li>
      <li>To provide <strong>digital literacy and support</strong> for farmers entering the e-commerce space.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ðŸ’¡ What Makes Us Different</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Farmer-first model</strong>: Every product listed comes straight from the sourceâ€”no middle agents involved.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic filtering tools</strong>: Users can search by product type or price range for transparent decision-making.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean and responsive platform</strong>: Designed with accessibility and simplicity so users of all backgrounds can navigate with ease.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At DFF, agriculture meets technology in a way thatâ€™s sustainable, ethical, and community-driven. We're not just building an applicationâ€”we're crafting a digital gateway that connects hearts and harvests, fields and families.</p>
